## About me üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


Currently, a Computer Science student at George Mason University

I am incredibly passionate about Machine Learning and iOS/macOS application development. I believe that these fields have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and the world around us.

In particular, I am interested in expanding our current scope with AI and computer vision. I believe that there is so much untapped potential in these fields, and I am excited to contribute to their growth and development. By pushing the boundaries of what is currently considered the norm, we can create innovative solutions that solve complex problems and make a meaningful impact on people's lives.

## Experience:

### Apple Intern

As an intern at Apple, I worked on the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process, creating new features and improvements to streamline and optimize the development workflow. This experience provided me with invaluable insights into the software development process and allowed me to develop my skills in a variety of programming languages and tools.

During my time at Apple, I had the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding about Git, as well as various scripting languages such as Shell, Ruby, and AppleScript.  These skills enabled me to contribute significantly to the development of new features and tools for the CI/CD process.

Over the course of my internship, I was able to create eight new features to improve the CI/CD process, each designed to address specific needs and constraints identified by other teams. By working collaboratively with my colleagues and leveraging my newfound expertise in Git and scripting languages, I was able to develop solutions that were efficient, effective, and tailored to the needs of the Apple development team. Identifying what bottlenecks our engineers have been facing and what tools we can extend to help aide with the CI/CD process. Fostering efficient development workflows and improved productivity, by engineers, for engineers.The opportunity to work on challenging projects and collaborate with cross-functional teams has been invaluable for my professional growth.


### Community Python Class

I had the incredible opportunity to help teach a Python class in Springfield through the ICNA organization. The goal of the class was to introduce members of the community to computer science and Python basics, with the aim of sparking their interest in the programming field.

While I wasn't the lead teacher, I played a supportive role in helping the instructor and the students throughout the course. It was incredibly rewarding to see the participants' excitement and engagement as they learned about the basics of Python programming.

Being able to share my knowledge and passion for computer science with others was an incredibly fulfilling experience, and I am grateful to have had the chance to contribute to the development of others' skills and interests in the field.

I look forward to continuing to find opportunities to teach and mentor others in the future, and I am committed to giving back to my community by sharing my knowledge
